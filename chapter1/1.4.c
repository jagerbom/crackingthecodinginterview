/*Write a method to decide if two strings are anagrams or not. 
 * I am not solving this here, this is very similar to the previous
 * questions.
 *
 * Solution 1: sort and compare
 * Solution 2: make another array of ascii characters and then see if
 * both string fill the array equally
 *
 * Direct cases: 
 * 1. Length of string should be same
 * 2. Null sting check
 * 3. Strcmp if strings are same
